Richard Feynman once said, 'What I cannot create, I do not understand.' Embracing this profound wisdom, I am Md. Ashiqur Rahman, a graduate in Industrial and Production Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET) as of September 2021. My academic odyssey has been guided by a fervent belief: true comprehension blossoms when we can teach and explore a subject in its entirety.

In the realm of science, my passion lies in crafting innovative solutions through the intricate understanding of human factors. I am deeply engrossed in the complexities of Human Systems Engineering, Decision Making under Uncertainty, and Quantitative Risk Analysis. My curiosity extends to solving intricate scheduling puzzles, ensuring impeccable quality in supply chain management, and optimizing the intricate dance of production and logistics planning. Armed with expertise in Python and MATLAB, I endeavor to utilize their full potential, leveraging Python libraries and MATLAB functions to simplify my research. Additionally, I wield statistical tools like SPSS and Minitab, enhancing the depth of my empirical inquiries.

A pivotal moment in my academic journey was my undergraduate thesis, a deep dive into the risk factors plaguing the ready-made garments industry. Through the integration of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods, I aimed to unearth insights that could mitigate the staggering rate of occupational accidents. It was a quest fueled by a desire to make a tangible difference in the lives of thousands affected each year.

Beyond the hallowed halls of academia, I find immeasurable joy in imparting knowledge. Teaching physics and mathematics to students in grades 9 through 12 has been an immensely gratifying experience, one that fuels my passion. When I'm not immersed in the world of learning and teaching, I find solace in exploring new destinations, embracing the wonders of travel.

Looking ahead, my vision is twofold â€” to be a beacon of knowledge as an educator and a trailblazer in research. I am driven by the relentless pursuit of conducting research that not only deepens our understanding of the human experience but also elevates the quality of life for all. This aspiration isn't just a goal; it's my unwavering commitment to the world of science and humanity
